This **5-day crash course** is designed to prepare candidates for **Technical Product Manager interviews** in the **fintech/lending space** (e.g., BorrowWorks Lending Platform).  
It blends **Agile product management**, **SQL data fluency**, **API ingestion**, **Python & R analytics**, and **interview storytelling** into a structured, intensive program.

By the end of this course, you will:
- ✅ Own a **product roadmap** and write **user stories** that impress interviewers.  
- ✅ Query SQL to validate product decisions.  
- ✅ Vet **API integrations** with quick Python prototypes.  
- ✅ Use **Python + R** for lightweight analytics & KPI dashboards.  
- ✅ Confidently handle **interview case questions** with structured answers.
